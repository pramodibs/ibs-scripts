issue: Kernel Panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
solution: reboot and select advanced mode --> old kernel image --> recovery mode --
select grub to repair and reboot

or we can do this by grub 
sudo update-initramfs -u -k version to generate the initrd for version (replace version with the kernel version string such as 4.15.0-36-generic) then sudo update-grub.

or
dpkg --configure -a
